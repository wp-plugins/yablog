Allows administrators to globally disable XML-RPC, new emoji functionality in WordPress 4.2, wp generator and feeds on their site.

== Description ==

Pretty simply, this plugin disables the XML-RPC API on a WordPress site running 3.5 or above.

Beginning in 3.5, XML-RPC is enabled by default. Additionally, the option to disable/enable XML-RPC was removed. For various reasons, site owners may wish to disable this functionality. This plugin provides an easy way to do so.

Also you may disable new emoji functionality in WordPress 4.2. and disable and remove from html links to the general feeds: Post and Comment Feed, and links to the extra feeds such as category feeds.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the disable-xml-rpc directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The plugin settings can be accessed via the 'Settings' menu in the administration area (either your site administration for single-site installs, or your network administration for network installs).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know if the plugin is working? =

There are two easy methods for checking if XML-RPC is off. First, try using an XML-RPC client, like the official WordPress mobile apps. Or you can try the XML-RPC Validator, written by Danilo Ercoli of the Automattic Mobile Team - the tool is available at [http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/](http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/) with a blog post about it at [http://daniloercoli.com/2012/05/15/wordpress-xml-rpc-endpoint-validator/](http://daniloercoli.com/2012/05/15/wordpress-xml-rpc-endpoint-validator/).
